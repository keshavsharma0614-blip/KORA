# KORA Studio

## Status

KORA Studio is a future planning area. It is not implemented yet.

## Purpose

KORA Studio is intended to become a local-first AI workspace for Mac and Linux that helps users run local LLM workflows, compare Standard Mode and KORA Boost, and inspect KORA execution paths, model-call counters, and validation reports.

## Core User Benefit

KORA Boost

Less waiting. Better answers. No hardware upgrade.

KORA Boost handles simple work through fast paths and saves model power for the tasks that need it.

## Initial Scope

The first MVP should focus on:

- Mac and Linux first
- CLI launch
- local browser UI
- local runtime detection
- Ollama-first model selection
- Standard Mode vs KORA Boost
- project-based chat
- execution path visibility
- model-call counters
- local validation report viewer
- local-only storage

## Non-Scope

KORA Studio v0.1 planning is:

- not a hosted SaaS product yet
- not a production monitoring platform yet
- not an API-cost dashboard yet
- not an energy dashboard yet
- not a real provider billing dashboard yet
- not a claim that KORA Studio is implemented today

## Source Artifacts

Likely source artifacts include:

- local validation Markdown reports
- JSON summaries from local validation examples
- synthetic workload files
- reviewer packet outputs
- future local model validation reports

## Public/Private Boundary

KORA Studio docs in public KORA should describe technical design, local validation artifacts, and contributor-friendly planning only. Internal product strategy, launch planning, campaign materials, and private operating notes belong in the private internals repo.

## Claim Boundary

KORA Studio planning does not create new benchmark claims. It should only visualize already generated validation counters and claim-safe reports.

# KORA Studio

## Status

KORA Studio is an early local implementation and planning area. It is not a complete product, hosted service, or production-ready workflow yet.

## Planning Scope

The Studio documents describe candidate UI, workflow, fixture, and report-viewer ideas until implementation work lands in code. Current KORA validation remains CLI-based through local examples and generated validation reports. Do not describe Studio behavior as shipped unless the corresponding runtime, CLI, or server code exists in this repository.

## Purpose

KORA Studio is intended to become a local-first AI Task Execution Router workspace for Mac and Linux. It should help users run local AI workflows, not just local models, by routing each task to the right execution path: CPU deterministic fast path, structured lookup, local model, or larger execution path only when needed.

KORA Studio is not an LM Studio replacement and should not be framed as merely a local chatbot. LM Studio helps users run local models. KORA Studio should help users route local AI workflows while keeping the model as one execution path, not the default path.

## Core User Benefit

KORA Boost

Less waiting. Better answers. No hardware upgrade.

KORA Boost handles simple work through fast paths and saves model power for the tasks that need it.

Standard Mode sends every step to the model. KORA Boost routes deterministic and structured tasks to CPU/local fast paths first. The model becomes one execution path, not the default path.

KORA does not make large models smaller and does not remove RAM, VRAM, unified-memory, or model-loading requirements. Larger-model workflow feasibility depends on the user's actual system memory, runtime support, quantization, and validation. KORA can make larger-model workflows lighter by sending less work to the model.

## Initial Scope

The first MVP should focus on:

- Mac and Linux first
- CLI launch
- local browser UI
- system profile
- model capability view
- local runtime detection
- Ollama-first model selection
- Standard Mode vs KORA Boost
- project-based chat
- execution path visibility
- model-call counters
- local validation report viewer
- local-only storage

## Non-Scope

KORA Studio v0.1 planning is:

- not a hosted SaaS product yet
- not a production monitoring platform yet
- not an API-cost dashboard yet
- not an energy dashboard yet
- not a real provider billing dashboard yet
- not a claim that KORA Studio is implemented today
- not an LM Studio replacement
- not a claim that KORA removes model memory requirements
- not a claim that unsupported larger models physically run on local hardware

## Source Artifacts

Likely source artifacts include:

- local validation Markdown reports
- JSON summaries from local validation examples
- synthetic workload files
- reviewer packet outputs
- future local model validation reports

## Public/Private Boundary

KORA Studio docs in public KORA should describe technical design, local validation artifacts, and contributor-friendly planning only. Internal product strategy, launch planning, campaign materials, and private operating notes belong in the private internals repo.

## Claim Boundary

KORA Studio planning does not create new benchmark claims. It should only visualize already generated validation counters and claim-safe reports.

## CLI Launch

The local KORA Studio preview can be launched with:

```bash
python3 -m kora studio
```

The command starts the localhost-only Studio server and attempts to open the default browser at `http://127.0.0.1:8765/`. It does not call a model runtime, call a provider, enable cloud sync, or require API keys. If browser launch fails, it prints the local URL and keeps serving locally.

Default launch behavior:

- `kora studio` starts the localhost-only Studio server
- opens the default browser automatically
- keeps provider calls disabled by default
- keeps cloud sync disabled by default
- requires no API key for default local mode
- if browser launch fails, prints the local URL and keeps serving locally

Developer/status options:

- `kora studio --no-browser`
- `kora studio --port 8765`
- `kora studio --status`
- optional future browser selector, such as `--browser chrome`

## Local Server Skeleton

A preview local-only server skeleton remains available through the compatibility flag:

```bash
python3 -m kora studio --serve
```

Status:

- preview/local-only skeleton
- default host: `127.0.0.1`
- default port: `8765`
- endpoints: `/health`, `/status`, `/`
- `/status` includes a local system profile scaffold and model capability estimate
- `/status` includes a static local model catalog scaffold and claim-safe recommendations
- `/status` includes a local runtime status scaffold and installed-model summary
- runtime service reachability is a localhost-only scaffold, not model execution readiness
- installed model detection is disabled/not connected by default
- `/status` includes informational runtime setup guidance metadata
- disabled model actions route to setup guidance, not an active installer
- `/status` includes local fixture/mock execution viewer events for the preview surface
- `/status` includes a local fixture/mock Standard Mode vs KORA Boost comparison
- `/status` includes a local report viewer/export placeholder based on fixture metadata
- browser launch enabled by default unless `--no-browser` is set
- no Ollama calls
- no runtime model list commands
- no private model directory scans
- no arbitrary local report file scans
- no report uploads
- no provider calls
- no cloud sync
- no API keys required

The server skeleton is not the full KORA Studio runtime or frontend. It exists to define the local server boundary for future Studio implementation work.

## Static Preview Page

The local server root serves a static UI prototype v0.1:

```bash
python3 -m kora studio
```

Open locally:

```text
http://127.0.0.1:8765/
```

The page shows a first-run flow ordered around launch/local-only status, Your Computer, Model Capability, Runtime Status, Catalog vs Installed, Setup Guidance, KORA Boost Boundary, Standard Mode vs KORA Boost, Execution Viewer placeholder, and Report Viewer placeholder. It uses embedded HTML/CSS, can be opened automatically by the CLI, does not call Ollama or providers, does not enable cloud sync, does not connect a model/runtime, does not download models, does not require API keys, and does not use a frontend framework yet. Use `python3 -m kora studio --no-browser` to keep serving locally without opening a browser. The model capability estimate and model catalog recommendations are local and heuristic; recommendations are estimates until validated and do not claim unsupported larger models can run. Catalog examples are not installed models. Runtime executable detection is local-only; service reachability is a localhost-only scaffold and is not model execution readiness. Installed model detection remains not connected unless future work implements a safe local method. The default path does not scan private model directories and does not run runtime model list commands. Download and run actions are visible only as disabled/planned UI scaffolding and route to informational setup guidance, not an active installer. The Standard Mode vs KORA Boost comparison, execution viewer events, and report viewer data are fixture/mock data and do not execute models, call providers, download models, scan arbitrary local report files, upload reports, or prove production behavior. KORA does not support all open-source LLMs by default.

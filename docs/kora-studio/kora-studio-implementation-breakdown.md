# KORA Studio Implementation Breakdown

## Status

This document breaks KORA Studio v0.1 planning into implementation phases. KORA Studio is not implemented yet.

## Implementation Principle

KORA Studio should start as a local-first, single-user, no-cloud AI Task Execution Router workspace for KORA validation artifacts, local model workflows, and task-path visibility.

KORA Studio should not be framed as an LM Studio replacement or a generic local chatbot. It should help users run local AI workflows by routing each task to the right execution path: deterministic CPU fast path, structured lookup, local model, or larger execution path only when needed.

- Mac/Linux first
- CLI launch first
- browser UI first
- local-only storage first
- Ollama-first runtime direction
- system profile and model capability narrative
- provider/cloud/distributed routes disabled by default
- no provider billing dashboard in v0.1
- no API-cost or energy claims

## Phase 0 — Planning and Fixtures

Goal: Prepare static fixtures and UI requirements before runtime code.

Tasks:

- define sample local validation JSON summary fixture
- define sample Markdown report fixture
- define dashboard counter schema
- define project/chat mock data
- define KORA Boost copy placement
- define no-cloud/no-API-key onboarding copy
- define AI Task Execution Router onboarding copy
- define system profile, model capability, and execution path UI copy

Deliverables:

- `docs/kora-studio/fixtures-plan.md`
- `docs/kora-studio/kora-studio-harness-engineering-spec.md`
- `docs/kora-studio/report-viewer-requirements.md`
- `docs/kora-studio/dashboard-counter-schema.md`
- `docs/kora-studio/fixture-schema-reference.md`
- `docs/kora-studio/fixtures/`

No code required.

## Phase 0.5 — Harness Engineering Specification

Status: Specification only. This phase does not implement new runtime behavior, provider calls, model downloads, or external network behavior.

Goal: Define the measurement and validation contract before expanding product UI claims.

Before expanding product UI claims, Studio harness engineering must define how system profiling, route events, metrics, adapters, and local reports are captured and validated.

Scope:

- system profile detection boundary
- model capability estimate boundary
- deterministic route event capture
- local model and adapter state event capture
- SSE/event replay schema
- Standard Mode vs KORA Boost comparison metrics
- local report export boundary
- provider/cloud disabled-by-default checks

Acceptance criteria:

- harness requirements are public-safe and claim-safe
- event schema and metrics are documented before UI expansion depends on them
- unsupported larger-model, production cost, real API-cost, and energy claims remain out of scope
- no provider/cloud route is enabled by default

## Phase 1 — CLI Launch Skeleton

Status: Initial CLI skeleton is available through `python3 -m kora studio`. It prints planning/preview status only; it does not start a server, open a browser, call a model runtime, or call a provider.

Goal: Evolve `kora studio` into the default local launch command for the Studio workspace.

Scope:

- command registration
- local-only status output
- default behavior eventually starts the localhost-only Studio server
- default behavior eventually opens the user's default browser automatically
- fallback behavior prints the local URL and keeps serving locally if browser launch fails
- developer mode supports `--no-browser` and `--port 8765`
- optional future browser selector such as `--browser chrome`
- no real model runtime calls
- no provider calls
- no cloud sync by default
- no API key required for default local mode

Acceptance criteria:

- `python3 -m kora studio --help` or equivalent works
- command clearly says Studio is experimental/planning if not fully implemented
- tests cover command availability

## Phase 2 — Local Studio Server Skeleton

Status: Initial local server skeleton is available through `python3 -m kora studio --serve`. It exposes preview `/health`, `/status`, and `/` endpoints on localhost only. It does not include the full frontend, runtime integration, model calls, browser launch, Ollama calls, or provider calls.

Goal: Create a local-only server boundary.

Scope:

- minimal local HTTP server or FastAPI-style skeleton if dependency already exists
- health endpoint
- static placeholder page endpoint
- no cloud upload
- no model calls
- no external network dependency

Acceptance criteria:

- local server starts and stops cleanly
- health endpoint returns local status
- tests do not require network beyond localhost

## Phase 3 — Static Web UI Prototype

Status: The local server root now serves a static preview page. The next step is to expand that placeholder into a static UI prototype while keeping it local-only and framework-free until a full frontend decision is made.

Goal: Create a static UI prototype for KORA Studio.

Screens:

- Welcome / Setup
- System Profile
- Model Capability
- Model Selection
- Project Chat Workspace
- Execution Trace Panel
- Report Viewer

Scope:

- static assets or minimal frontend structure
- system profile copy that explains what the computer can physically run
- model capability copy that separates physically runnable local models, larger-model workflow feasibility, and optional external/provider/distributed routes
- KORA Boost copy explaining that deterministic and structured tasks route to CPU/local fast paths first
- execution path UI copy for deterministic code, structured lookup, local model, larger model, and disabled-by-default external/provider/distributed route
- no runtime calls
- no model downloads
- no account system

Acceptance criteria:

- UI can be served locally
- KORA Boost copy appears correctly
- planning-only status is clear

## Phase 3.5 — System Profile and Model Capability Scaffold

Status: Initial local scaffold exists in the preview server. `/status` includes `system_profile` and `model_capability_estimate`, and the static preview page shows read-only system/model capability panels.

Scope:

- safe executable detection for runtime candidates
- local heuristic model capability estimate
- unknown/fail-closed memory fallback
- provider calls disabled by default
- cloud sync disabled by default
- no runtime API calls
- no model downloads
- no model execution

Acceptance criteria:

- recommendations are labelled as estimates until validated
- no unsupported larger-model claim is shown
- no provider/cloud route is enabled by default

## Phase 3.6 — Model Catalog Planning Scaffold

Status: Initial static local scaffold exists in the preview server. `/status` includes `model_catalog_status`, `recommended_models`, and `model_catalog_claim_boundary`, and the static preview page shows a read-only model catalog preview.

- no unsupported larger-model local execution claim is shown
- no download or execution action is connected

## Phase 3.7 — Runtime Status and Installed Model Scaffold

Status: Initial local scaffold exists in the preview server. `/status` includes `runtime_status`, localhost-only service reachability fields, `installed_models_summary`, and catalog/runtime distinction copy, and the static preview page shows read-only runtime and installed-model panels.

Scope:

- local runtime executable detection
- runtime service reachability scaffolded as a localhost-only check
- service reachability is not model execution readiness
- installed model detection marked `not_connected` by default
- installed model detection fields for enabled state, method, count, error, and claim boundary
- catalog examples distinguished from installed models
- download disabled
- execution disabled
- no private model directory scans
- no model listing calls
- no model execution
- no model downloads
- no remote registry calls
- no provider/cloud route

Acceptance criteria:

- runtime executable detection is local-only
- service reachability does not execute, list, pull, or download models
- catalog examples are not presented as installed models
- no model is shown as installed unless safely confirmed
- default installed-model detection does not scan private model directories or run model list commands
- no download or execution action is connected

## Phase 3.8 — Disabled Model Action Scaffold

## Phase 3.9 — Runtime Setup Guidance Scaffold

Status: Initial informational setup guidance exists in `kora-studio-runtime-setup-guidance.md`. `/status` includes setup guidance metadata, and disabled actions route to guidance copy rather than active install, download, or run behavior.

Scope:

- setup guidance docs path
- disabled actions route to guidance
- catalog vs installed vs downloadable boundary
- runtime readiness distinction
- no install commands
- no model downloads
- no model execution

## Claim-Safety Rules

- do not claim KORA Studio exists until code exists
- do not claim KORA Studio is an LM Studio replacement
- do not frame KORA Studio as merely a local chatbot
- do not claim production cost reduction
- do not claim real API-cost reduction

- do not claim larger models physically run unless validated
- do not claim KORA removes RAM, VRAM, unified-memory, or model-loading requirements
- do not claim all open-source LLMs are supported
- keep provider/cloud/distributed execution disabled by default unless explicitly enabled
- use "Less waiting. Better answers. No hardware upgrade." as product benefit copy
- use technical explanation after benefit copy

## Implementation Order Recommendation

1. fixtures and schemas

## Private Internals Repo Reviewed

Private repository reviewed locally:

```text
/Users/albertkim/02_PROJECTS/05_KORA_Project/repo/internals
```

Remote:

```text
https://github.com/Krako-Labs/internals.git
```

Private commit reviewed:

```text
849e0ab77df79f7e593197452f531f5c6344e7fe
```

The private repo contains the internal KORA operations structure for messaging, community management, social media, visual assets, launch planning, and claim tracking. Those internal materials do not need to be mirrored into the public KORA repository.

## Message Review Result

Pass.

The README opens with the developer pain message:

```text
Most AI apps call the model too soon.
```

The README defines KORA as open-source execution control for AI workloads, includes the before/after path, and uses:

```text
Structure first. Inference second.
```

Krako is not used as the README hero narrative. It appears near the bottom in the Ecosystem section with:

```text
KORA is part of the broader Krako infrastructure.
Krako 2.0: TBD
```

## Claim Hygiene Review Result

Pass.

The current approved public alpha claim is used:

```text
KORA reduced model invocations by 80% in a reproducible deterministic-heavy benchmark workload.
```

The README keeps claim boundaries below the opening section. Benchmark methodology docs preserve the simulated-baseline details without turning the README headline into a simulated-counter explanation.

Forbidden claims were checked and not introduced as current claims:

- production cost reduction proof
- real API-cost reduction proof
- production benchmark proof
- full runtime-integrated benchmark evidence
- broad workload superiority proof
- energy reduction evidence
- formal government validation
- signed partner validation unless actually signed and documented
- guaranteed adoption or funding

## Public/Private Separation Review Result

Pass after follow-up correction.

The public PR docs do not add private operating playbooks, private prompt materials, or person-specific operating instructions.

During review, `docs/README.md` still contained internal-style operating-handoff wording. That was replaced with a public documentation boundary note suitable for an open-source docs index.

## Image Placeholder Review Result

Pass.

The SVG files are valid technical placeholders. They show execution-control paths, validation-roadmap structure, benchmark counters, and help-test flow. They do not imply production cost savings, energy savings, GPU savings, real API-cost reduction, or production validation.

## Validation Commands And Results

Public KORA validation:

```bash
git diff --check
```

Result: passed.

```bash
xmllint --noout docs/assets/kora-execution-control-overview.svg docs/assets/kora-validation-roadmap.svg docs/assets/kora-benchmark-evidence-card.svg docs/assets/kora-help-test-flow.svg
```

Result: passed.

```bash
python3 -m pytest
```

Result: `54 passed`.

```bash
python3 -m kora --help
```

Result: passed.

```bash
python3 -m kora examples list
```

Result: passed.

```bash
python3 -m kora run direct_vs_kora -- --offline
```

Result: passed.

```bash
python3 -m kora run runtime_integrated_benchmark -- --offline
```

Result: passed with `ok: true`, `total_tasks: 100`, `avoided_simulated_model_invocations: 80`, and `mismatch_count: 0`.

Private internals validation:

```bash
git status --short --branch
```

Result: clean on `main...origin/main`.

```bash
git diff --check
```

Result: passed.

File tree inspection confirmed the expected private internal structure under `projects/kora/`, `functions/`, and `templates/`.

Secret-pattern grep found no committed secrets. Matches were limited to policy language such as "API keys", "passwords", "credentials", or ordinary words such as "tokens".

## Remaining TODOs

- `Krako 2.0: TBD` remains intentionally because no canonical public repo URL is known from official repo context.
- Public docs still use a TODO for the canonical GitHub Discussions URL and maintainer contact route.
- SVG files are technical placeholders, not final marketing images.

## Merge Recommendation

Recommended to merge after this review report commit is pushed and CI, if any, remains green.

Do not create tags, releases, release assets, package version changes, GitHub issues, project boards, repository settings changes, or raw benchmark artifact uploads as part of the merge.

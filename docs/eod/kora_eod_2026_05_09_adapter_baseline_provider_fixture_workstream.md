## Public HEAD At Start

`66f25119240d328e3446a8ccb3481f79c84419c0`

## Current Validation State

- `python3 -m pytest` -> `139 passed`
- Public exposure scan -> no matches
- Claim safety scan -> only explicit non-claim / boundary language
- Network/provider safety scan -> no unsafe executable provider/runtime dependency
- Secret/data safety scan -> no real secrets

## Completed Workstream Summary

- Repo-specific GitHub credential/context separation completed.
- Public internal workflow exposure cleanup completed.
- Explicit adapter-selection option completed.
- Opt-in `local_runtime` adapter completed.
- Real provider adapter design-only packet completed.
- Real provider test harness design-only packet completed.
- Provider fixture dry-run contract completed.
- Local validation report packet upgraded.
- Provider fixture report integration completed.

## Merged PRs

- PR #69: public internal workflow cleanup
- PR #70: local validation reviewer packet polish
- PR #71: opt-in local runtime adapter
- PR #72: real provider adapter design packet
- PR #73: real provider test harness design packet
- PR #74: provider fixture dry-run contract
- PR #75: local validation report packet upgrade
- PR #76: provider fixture report integration

## Current Adapter State

- Default adapter: `local_validation`
- Explicit local adapter: `local_runtime`
- `local_runtime` provider label: `local_runtime`
- `local_runtime` model label: `deterministic-local-runtime`
- `blocked` remains fail-closed
- `local_runtime_placeholder` remains fail-closed/design-only
- Future real provider adapter remains design-only; no implementation yet

## Current Baseline Summary

- `runtime_integrated_benchmark --offline`: avoided simulated invocations `80/100`
- `real_model_call_validation_fake --adapter local_runtime`: baseline `10`, KORA `4`, avoided `6`
- `customer_support_triage_fake_validation --adapter local_runtime`: baseline `12`, KORA `4`, avoided `8`

## Current Report Packet State

- `fixture_contract_status`: `passed`
- `no_network`: `yes`
- `no_provider_call`: `yes`
- `provider_attempted_events`: `0`
- Baseline / KORA / avoided counters included
- Safety boundaries included
- Interpretation included
- Explicit non-claims included

## Current Provider Fixture State

- Stdlib-only dry-run fixture validator
- Requires `no_network=true`
- Requires `no_provider_call=true`
- Rejects real provider responses
- Rejects customer data
- Rejects secret material
- Rejects negative counters
- Rejects unsafe modes
- Rejects `provider_attempted_events > 0`

## Safe Interpretation

KORA's local/no-network validation now provides reproducible synthetic evidence that KORA can measure avoided model-call events under deterministic and fixture-validated conditions.

## Safe Public Claim

KORA reduced model invocations by 80% in a reproducible deterministic-heavy benchmark workload.

## Explicit Non-Claims

- no production cost reduction proof
- no real API-cost reduction proof
- no production benchmark proof
- no full runtime-integrated real-provider benchmark evidence
- no broad workload superiority proof
- no energy reduction evidence
- no formal government validation
- no signed partner validation unless actually signed and documented
- no guaranteed adoption or funding

## Next Public Technical Priorities

1. Optional old worktree cleanup after explicit approval.
2. Future real-provider work only after explicit approval and safety gates.
3. No provider/API/cost/energy claim expansion until real evidence exists.

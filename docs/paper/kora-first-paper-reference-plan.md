# KORA First Paper Reference Plan

## Purpose

This document defines reference targets and verification status for the first KORA paper. It is a planning scaffold for collecting references without adding unverified citations, invented BibTeX entries, or unsupported claims.

## Reference Rules

- Do not add fake citations.
- Verify every paper or project before citing it.
- Prefer peer-reviewed papers, official project papers, official documentation, or stable public technical reports.
- Record source type for each candidate reference.
- Record verification status for each candidate reference.
- Do not overstate similarity, difference, or superiority.

## Reference Categories

### 1. LLM serving and inference systems

Why this category matters:

KORA discusses reducing model invocations in deterministic-heavy workloads, so the paper needs background on systems that optimize serving, inference throughput, scheduling, batching, and runtime efficiency.

What kind of reference is needed:

Peer-reviewed systems papers, official project papers, official technical reports, or stable project documentation for LLM serving and inference systems.

Target count:

3-5 verified references.

Verification status:

Partially verified. See [KORA first paper reference tracker](kora-first-paper-reference-tracker.md).

### 2. Agent/tool routing and orchestration

Why this category matters:

KORA routes work through execution-control paths before inference. The paper should distinguish deterministic-first execution control from agent loops, tool calling, planners, and model-centered orchestration.

What kind of reference is needed:

Verified papers, official docs, or stable technical reports covering agent frameworks, tool routing, graph-based agents, or orchestration patterns.

Target count:

2-4 verified references.

Verification status:

Partially verified. See [KORA first paper reference tracker](kora-first-paper-reference-tracker.md).

### 3. Deterministic/programmatic AI workflows

Why this category matters:

KORA relies on deterministic routes, structured handlers, policy checks, and validation boundaries when model inference is not required.

What kind of reference is needed:

References on programmatic control, typed or structured AI workflows, validation-centered execution, constrained generation, or deterministic components around model systems.

Target count:

2-4 verified references.

Verification status:

Partially verified. See [KORA first paper reference tracker](kora-first-paper-reference-tracker.md).

### 4. Caching and retrieval-augmented generation

Why this category matters:

KORA must be positioned clearly against caching and retrieval-augmented generation. Caching can reuse previous results, and RAG can ground generation, but KORA's contribution is execution-control routing before deciding whether inference is needed.

What kind of reference is needed:

Foundational RAG papers or surveys, plus verified references for caching or semantic-cache systems if they are directly relevant.

Target count:

3-5 verified references.

Verification status:

Partially verified. See [KORA first paper reference tracker](kora-first-paper-reference-tracker.md).

### 5. Workflow orchestration / DAG systems

Why this category matters:

KORA uses task paths and execution-control concepts that are adjacent to workflow orchestration and DAG execution, while applying them to model-call boundaries and validation counters.

What kind of reference is needed:

Official docs, project papers, or technical reports for workflow orchestration, task graphs, DAG execution, or distributed workflow systems.

Target count:

2-4 verified references.

Verification status:

Partially verified. See [KORA first paper reference tracker](kora-first-paper-reference-tracker.md).

### 6. Benchmarking and reproducibility

Why this category matters:

The first KORA paper depends on reproducible deterministic-heavy benchmark evidence and local/no-network validation language. It needs references that support careful benchmark design and transparent reproduction.

What kind of reference is needed:

References on benchmark methodology, reproducibility, synthetic workloads, artifact reporting, and evaluation transparency.

Target count:

2-4 verified references.

Verification status:

Partially verified. See [KORA first paper reference tracker](kora-first-paper-reference-tracker.md).

### 7. Local model runtime systems

Why this category matters:

Local model runtime validation is future work. The paper should cite local runtime systems only after verifying official sources and only as context, not as current KORA evidence.

What kind of reference is needed:

Official docs, project papers, or stable technical reports for local model runtime systems.

Target count:

1-3 verified references.

Verification status:

Partially verified. See [KORA first paper reference tracker](kora-first-paper-reference-tracker.md).

### 8. Systems papers with artifact evaluation practices

Why this category matters:

KORA's paper should follow systems-style evidence discipline: clear claims, reproducible commands, artifact boundaries, and explicit limitations.

What kind of reference is needed:

Artifact evaluation guidelines, systems conference artifact practices, or papers that model clear reproduction and evaluation reporting.

Target count:

2-4 verified references.

Verification status:

Partially verified. See [KORA first paper reference tracker](kora-first-paper-reference-tracker.md).

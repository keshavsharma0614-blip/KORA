# KORA First Paper arXiv Source Package Hygiene v0.1

Status date: 2026-05-13

## Purpose

This checklist defines source-package hygiene expectations for a future arXiv-style package. It does not create a package, does not upload to arXiv, and does not mark the paper as submission-ready.

## Include Only Build-Needed Files

The package should include only files needed to build or review the final paper package:

- final paper source,
- final bibliography source,
- approved figure files or approved source equivalents,
- required style files,
- required appendix or artifact-description source.

## Exclude

Exclude:

- private or local paths,
- raw benchmark artifacts,
- temporary build outputs,
- generated logs unless explicitly needed,
- `/tmp` outputs,
- hidden comments and unrelated planning notes,
- provider responses,
- API keys and credentials,
- private user data,
- production traffic,
- release assets,
- large unused files.

## Secret and Path Checks

Before any upload, inspect source files for:

```text
sk-
ghp_
password=
secret=
api_key=
OPENAI_API_KEY=
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=
```

Also inspect manually for absolute local home paths, private local context paths, and internal workflow markers.

Any match must be removed or explicitly justified before packaging.

## Claim Boundary Checks

Before any upload, inspect source files for unsupported claims:

```text
production cost reduction
real API-cost reduction
production benchmark proof
full runtime-integrated real-provider benchmark evidence
broad workload superiority
energy reduction
formal government validation
guaranteed adoption
formal artifact approval
formally approved
```

Boundary or limitation wording may be appropriate in planning docs, but the final source package should only include claim language intentionally meant for the paper.

## Residual File Warning

arXiv source files may become downloadable after submission. Avoid unnecessary residual files, local-only notes, debug comments, temporary outputs, or unrelated planning artifacts in the source package.

## Metadata Checks

Before upload, confirm:

- final arXiv category and category compatibility,
- license choice,
- title and abstract,
- author display,
- affiliation and email display,
- comments field if used,
- final bibliography formatting,
- final figure/table rendering.

## Status

This is a hygiene checklist only. No source package was created, no upload was performed, and the paper remains not submission-ready.

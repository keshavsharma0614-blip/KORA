# KORA First Paper Citation Audit v0.1

## Purpose

This audit checks reference consistency, citation safety, and claim boundaries for manuscript v0.2 and the selected manuscript v0.3 integration of [R11], [R12], and [R13]. It is a bibliography-readiness document, not a final bibliography and not a submission-readiness claim.

## Scope

This audit covers:

- manuscript v0.2
- manuscript v0.3 selected reference integration
- references [R01] through [R24]
- preliminary references section
- related work framing
- claim boundary language

It does not add BibTeX, final citation style, manuscript-integrated citations beyond the current manuscript, or new evidence claims.

The working citation style strategy is recorded in [KORA First Paper Citation Style Decision](kora-first-paper-citation-style-decision.md). Stable `[Rxx]` labels remain the working style until metadata audit, bibliography normalization, and any later venue-specific conversion are complete.

Reference metadata readiness is recorded in [KORA First Paper Reference Metadata Audit v0.1](kora-first-paper-reference-metadata-audit-v0-1.md). That audit does not generate BibTeX and does not change manuscript claim support.

## Claim-Support Mapping

| Claim or statement type | References used | Supported use | Boundary |

## Forbidden Citation Uses

- Do not cite external systems as proof KORA is superior.
- Do not cite references as production cost reduction proof.
- Do not cite references as real API-cost reduction proof.
- Do not cite references as energy reduction evidence.
- Do not cite references as production benchmark evidence.
- Do not cite references as formal artifact evaluation approval.

## Bibliography Gaps

- Final citation style selection pending.
- BibTeX pending.
- Exact venue/metadata audit pending where needed.
- Additional references for agent/tool-use partially expanded in pass 2.
- Semantic caching reference partially added in pass 2.
- Synthetic workload and benchmark-construction references partially added in the benchmark-construction pass.
- Local runtime references partially expanded in pass 2.
- Venue-specific artifact guidance partially expanded in pass 2.

## Additional Reference Verification Pass 2

Pass date: 2026-05-11.

Additional verified references: 8.

Categories covered:

- agent/tool-use and agentic workflows
- program-aided language-model workflows
- semantic caching
- local model runtime systems
- reproducibility programs and checklists
- venue-specific artifact evaluation guidance

Categories still missing:

- more synthetic workload and benchmark-construction references
- target-venue-specific citation style and artifact guidance once a target venue is selected
- optional additional semantic-cache references if the manuscript discusses caching in more detail

Manuscript integration status:

- References [R11] through [R18] were verified tracker entries only in this pass.
- References [R11], [R12], and [R13] were later integrated into manuscript v0.3 text and its preliminary References section.
- References [R14] through [R18] remain tracker/audit-only, optional, or deferred according to the v0.3 integration plan.
- This does not complete final citation style, BibTeX, or final bibliography normalization.

## Manuscript v0.3 Integration Status

Manuscript v0.3 integrates selected pass-2 references.

Status:

- [R11] ReAct appears in manuscript v0.3 related work and the preliminary References section.
- [R12] Toolformer appears in manuscript v0.3 related work and the preliminary References section.
- [R13] PAL appears in manuscript v0.3 related work and the preliminary References section.
- [R14] through [R18] remain tracker/audit-only, optional, or deferred.
- Final citation audit is not complete.
- BibTeX remains pending.
- Final citation style remains pending.

## Benchmark-Construction Reference Verification Pass

Pass date: 2026-05-11.

Additional verified references: 6.

New verified labels: `[R19]` through `[R24]`.

Categories covered:

- broad benchmark-suite construction for language-model capabilities
- holistic and multi-metric evaluation methodology
- software-engineering task benchmark construction
- agent benchmark construction
- dynamic benchmark methodology
- behavior-oriented evaluation and test design

Categories still missing:

- references that specifically discuss deterministic-heavy synthetic workload construction for model-call routing systems
- final target-venue guidance after venue selection
- final decisions about which benchmark-methodology references belong in manuscript text

Manuscript integration status:

- References `[R19]` through `[R24]` are tracker/audit entries only in this pass.
- They are intended to support future benchmark-methodology background, not current manuscript claims.
- KORA's 80/100 result remains supported by KORA's own reproducible deterministic-heavy benchmark evidence, not by external references.
- These references do not prove production cost reduction, real API-cost reduction, energy reduction, production benchmark evidence, or broad workload superiority.
- This pass does not complete final citation style, BibTeX, final bibliography normalization, or final citation audit.

## Next Step

- Decide whether selected `[R19]` through `[R24]` references should be integrated into a future benchmark-methodology section.
- Use metadata audit v0.1 to prepare a normalized bibliography table for `[R01]` through `[R24]`.
- Manuscript v0.3 still requires final bibliography and claim-audit review before any submission-readiness claim.

# KORA First Paper Submission-Candidate Status v0.1

Status date: 2026-05-13

## Purpose

This status note records the bundled manuscript synchronization and claim-to-evidence pass that produced manuscript v0.4 as a submission-candidate draft. It does not mark the paper as submission-ready.

## Manuscript v0.4

Manuscript v0.4 was created:

- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-manuscript-v0-4.md`

v0.4 is a submission-candidate draft, not a final submission package.

## Manuscript v0.5

Manuscript v0.5 was created:

- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-manuscript-v0-5.md`

v0.5 is a submission-candidate draft that mechanically inserts the prior figure, table, algorithm, and appendix artifact materials into the manuscript. It is not a final submission package.

## What Was Synchronized

- Manuscript citations were compared against preliminary BibTeX v0.1.
- Manuscript v0.3 cited `[R02]`, which remains still-not-eligible and absent from preliminary BibTeX.
- Manuscript v0.4 removes `[R02]` from background-only text and the preliminary references section.
- Manuscript v0.4 now cites only records currently present in preliminary BibTeX.
- Preliminary BibTeX still has 16 entries.
- Unused preliminary BibTeX entries remain `[R14]`, `[R16]`, `[R21]`, and `[R24]`.

## Claim Wording

The bounded claim is preserved:

> KORA reduced model invocations by 80% in a reproducible deterministic-heavy benchmark workload.

No production, API-cost, energy, broad superiority, formal approval, or submission-readiness claim was added.

## Remaining Required Blockers

- Full BibTeX remains incomplete.
- `[R02]`, `[R15]`, `[R19]`, `[R20]`, `[R22]`, and `[R23]` remain still-not-eligible.
- `[R17]` and `[R18]` remain deferred.
- Final citation style conversion and final bibliography formatting remain pending.
- Final manuscript-to-final-BibTeX synchronization remains pending.
- Final claim-to-evidence audit must be repeated after any future manuscript or bibliography changes.
- Final figures and tables are not locked.
- Final export package is not prepared.
- Clean reproduction transcript and artifact package review remain pending.
- Final human review remains pending.

## User Approval Still Needed

- Target venue or target package format.
- Whether `[R17]` and `[R18]` should be included or excluded once venue direction is known.
- Whether benchmark-methodology records `[R19]` through `[R24]` should be integrated into the manuscript methodology section.
- Whether optional workload, latency, API-cost, production-traffic, or energy work stays out of the first submission scope.

## Target Venue, Export, and Package Decisions

The first target package direction is arXiv-style technical report / preprint. Endorsement has been obtained and is not a current blocker. arXiv category compatibility, license, export format, and final human approval remain pending. No conference, workshop, or journal target has been selected.

## arXiv-Style Package Draft

The arXiv-style package draft docs now exist:

- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-arxiv-metadata-checklist-v0-1.md`
- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-arxiv-bibliography-scope-v0-1.md`
- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-arxiv-style-package-readiness-v0-1.md`
- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-future-venue-scan-v0-1.md`

These files record the supplied author metadata, endorsement status, conservative bibliography scope, original systems/evaluation framing, and future venue-scan placeholder. They do not submit to arXiv, select an arXiv category, select a conference/workshop/journal, or mark the paper as submission-ready.

## Figure, Table, and Algorithm Asset Pass

The figure/table/algorithm asset pass now exists:

- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-figure-table-algorithm-plan-v0-1.md`
- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-figure-table-algorithm-drafts-v0-1.md`

These files inventory existing visual assets, draft paper-ready text diagrams, benchmark tables, an evidence-boundary table, deterministic-first routing pseudocode, and an appendix artifact inventory table. Manuscript v0.4 was not edited in this pass; final insertion, numbering, layout, and export treatment require human review.

## Manuscript Asset Insertion Pass

Manuscript v0.5 now inserts:

- Figure 1: KORA execution-control architecture.
- Figure 2: direct baseline vs KORA-controlled benchmark flow.
- Table 1: deterministic-heavy benchmark result summary.
- Table 2: evidence boundary and non-claim table.
- Algorithm 1: deterministic-first routing pseudocode.
- Appendix Table A1: artifact and reproducibility inventory.

The inserted assets remain draft Markdown/Mermaid/text assets. Final rendering, numbering, layout, and export treatment remain pending.

## v0.5 Render and Export Readiness Pass

The v0.5 render/export readiness report and text-only export manifest now exist:

- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-v0-5-render-export-readiness-v0-1.md`
- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-arxiv-export-package-manifest-v0-1.md`

No dedicated paper export pipeline was found. No PDF, rendered figure, binary export, or raw benchmark artifact was generated or committed. The manuscript remains suitable for repository Markdown review, but final arXiv-compatible export requires a chosen export route and figure rendering/conversion.

## arXiv Export Route Dry Run

The export-route dry run and recommendation now exist:

- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-arxiv-export-route-dry-run-v0-1.md`
- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-arxiv-export-route-recommendation-v0-1.md`

Pandoc-generated LaTeX and HTML outputs were tested under `/tmp/kora-paper-export-dry-run` only. No PDF was generated because a LaTeX engine is not installed locally. No generated outputs or binary figures were committed. The recommended route is a Pandoc-to-LaTeX starting export followed by manual cleanup for Mermaid diagrams, wide tables, and bibliography formatting.

## Local Export Tooling Plan

The local export tooling setup guide, dry-build command plan, and source-package hygiene checklist now exist:

- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-local-export-tooling-setup-v0-1.md`
- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-arxiv-dry-build-command-plan-v0-1.md`
- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-arxiv-source-package-hygiene-v0-1.md`

No system packages were installed automatically. A full `/tmp` dry build was not attempted because the required LaTeX/PDF and Mermaid rendering tools are still missing locally.

## Installed-Tools Dry Build

The installed-tools dry-build result now exists:

- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-arxiv-dry-build-result-v0-1.md`

The `/tmp` dry build generated rendered Mermaid figure PDFs, LaTeX source, and a PDF using Mermaid CLI with a local browser path and Tectonic. Generated outputs stayed under `/tmp` and were not committed. Final layout cleanup, bibliography integration, source-package hygiene, and human review remain pending.

## Dry Build Output Review

The dry-build output review now exists:

- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-arxiv-dry-build-output-review-v0-1.md`

The review confirms the `/tmp` output inventory, cleaned source-package folder, and remaining blockers. No generated binaries or source-package files were committed.

## Word Draft and Figure Redesign Pass

The Word-first review route is now active, and PDF/arXiv source-package generation is paused. The Word draft review and figure redesign notes now exist:

- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-word-draft-review-v0-1.md`
- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-figure-redesign-note-v0-1.md`

Local-only Word drafts and redesigned Figure 1/Figure 2 PNG/SVG assets were generated outside the public repository. No generated DOCX, PDF, PNG, SVG, source package, or local working Markdown was committed.

## Word Figure Placeholder Pass

The image-inserted Word draft is superseded for review because human review found that inserted figure arrows and diagram elements did not render reliably. Word-first manuscript text review now continues with placeholders:

- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-word-placeholder-review-v0-1.md`

Figure 1 and Figure 2 are placeholders only. Current figure rendering should not be treated as publication-ready. Final publication-quality figures must be rebuilt separately after manuscript-body review is complete and the body text is stable. No generated DOCX, PDF, image, source package, binary output, or local working Markdown was committed.

## Submission Package Packet

The venue-neutral submission package readiness packet now exists:

- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-submission-package-readiness-v0-1.md`
- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-final-human-review-packet-v0-1.md`
- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-reproduction-transcript-checklist-v0-1.md`
- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-artifact-package-inventory-v0-1.md`

These files organize package blockers, human review decisions, reproduction transcript expectations, and artifact inventory. They do not select a venue, finalize an export package, or mark the paper as submission-ready.

## Status

The manuscript has advanced to v0.5 submission-candidate draft status. Full BibTeX remains incomplete, Word-first human review is now the active route with Figure 1 and Figure 2 placeholders, and final visual review, figure rebuilding, layout cleanup, bibliography formatting, source-package hygiene, and human review remain pending. PDF/arXiv export remains paused until both manuscript text and final figures are ready. The paper remains not submission-ready.

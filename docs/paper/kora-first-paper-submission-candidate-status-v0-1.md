# KORA First Paper Submission-Candidate Status v0.1

Status date: 2026-05-13

## Purpose

This status note records the bundled manuscript synchronization and claim-to-evidence pass that produced manuscript v0.4 as a submission-candidate draft. It does not mark the paper as submission-ready.

## Manuscript v0.4

Manuscript v0.4 was created:

- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-manuscript-v0-4.md`

v0.4 is a submission-candidate draft, not a final submission package.

## Manuscript v0.5

Manuscript v0.5 was created:

- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-manuscript-v0-5.md`

v0.5 is a submission-candidate draft that mechanically inserts the prior figure, table, algorithm, and appendix artifact materials into the manuscript. It is not a final submission package.

## What Was Synchronized

- Manuscript citations were compared against preliminary BibTeX v0.1.
- Manuscript v0.3 cited `[R02]`, which remains still-not-eligible and absent from preliminary BibTeX.
- Manuscript v0.4 removes `[R02]` from background-only text and the preliminary references section.
- Manuscript v0.4 now cites only records currently present in preliminary BibTeX.
- Preliminary BibTeX still has 16 entries.
- Unused preliminary BibTeX entries remain `[R14]`, `[R16]`, `[R21]`, and `[R24]`.

## Claim Wording

The bounded claim is preserved:

> KORA reduced model invocations by 80% in a reproducible deterministic-heavy benchmark workload.

No production, API-cost, energy, broad superiority, formal approval, or submission-readiness claim was added.

## Remaining Required Blockers

- Full BibTeX remains incomplete.
- `[R02]`, `[R15]`, `[R19]`, `[R20]`, `[R22]`, and `[R23]` remain still-not-eligible.
- `[R17]` and `[R18]` remain deferred.
- Final citation style conversion and final bibliography formatting remain pending.
- Final manuscript-to-final-BibTeX synchronization remains pending.
- Final claim-to-evidence audit must be repeated after any future manuscript or bibliography changes.
- Final figures and tables are not locked.
- Final export package is not prepared.
- Clean reproduction transcript and artifact package review remain pending.
- Final human review remains pending.

## User Approval Still Needed

- Target venue or target package format.
- Whether `[R17]` and `[R18]` should be included or excluded once venue direction is known.
- Whether benchmark-methodology records `[R19]` through `[R24]` should be integrated into the manuscript methodology section.
- Whether optional workload, latency, API-cost, production-traffic, or energy work stays out of the first submission scope.

## Target Venue, Export, and Package Decisions

The first target package direction is arXiv-style technical report / preprint. Endorsement has been obtained and is not a current blocker. arXiv category compatibility, license, export format, and final human approval remain pending. No conference, workshop, or journal target has been selected.

## arXiv-Style Package Draft

The arXiv-style package draft docs now exist:

- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-arxiv-metadata-checklist-v0-1.md`
- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-arxiv-bibliography-scope-v0-1.md`
- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-arxiv-style-package-readiness-v0-1.md`
- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-future-venue-scan-v0-1.md`

These files record the supplied author metadata, endorsement status, conservative bibliography scope, original systems/evaluation framing, and future venue-scan placeholder. They do not submit to arXiv, select an arXiv category, select a conference/workshop/journal, or mark the paper as submission-ready.

## Figure, Table, and Algorithm Asset Pass

The figure/table/algorithm asset pass now exists:

- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-figure-table-algorithm-plan-v0-1.md`
- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-figure-table-algorithm-drafts-v0-1.md`

These files inventory existing visual assets, draft paper-ready text diagrams, benchmark tables, an evidence-boundary table, deterministic-first routing pseudocode, and an appendix artifact inventory table. Manuscript v0.4 was not edited in this pass; final insertion, numbering, layout, and export treatment require human review.

## Manuscript Asset Insertion Pass

Manuscript v0.5 now inserts:

- Figure 1: KORA execution-control architecture.
- Figure 2: direct baseline vs KORA-controlled benchmark flow.
- Table 1: deterministic-heavy benchmark result summary.
- Table 2: evidence boundary and non-claim table.
- Algorithm 1: deterministic-first routing pseudocode.
- Appendix Table A1: artifact and reproducibility inventory.

The inserted assets remain draft Markdown/Mermaid/text assets. Final rendering, numbering, layout, and export treatment remain pending.

## v0.5 Render and Export Readiness Pass

The v0.5 render/export readiness report and text-only export manifest now exist:

- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-v0-5-render-export-readiness-v0-1.md`
- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-arxiv-export-package-manifest-v0-1.md`

No dedicated paper export pipeline was found. No PDF, rendered figure, binary export, or raw benchmark artifact was generated or committed. The manuscript remains suitable for repository Markdown review, but final arXiv-compatible export requires a chosen export route and figure rendering/conversion.

## Submission Package Packet

The venue-neutral submission package readiness packet now exists:

- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-submission-package-readiness-v0-1.md`
- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-final-human-review-packet-v0-1.md`
- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-reproduction-transcript-checklist-v0-1.md`
- `docs/paper/kora-first-paper-artifact-package-inventory-v0-1.md`

These files organize package blockers, human review decisions, reproduction transcript expectations, and artifact inventory. They do not select a venue, finalize an export package, or mark the paper as submission-ready.

## Status

The manuscript has advanced to v0.5 submission-candidate draft status. Full BibTeX remains incomplete, final export route and asset rendering/conversion remain pending, and the paper remains not submission-ready.

# KORA First Paper Normalized Bibliography v0.1

## Purpose

This document normalizes bibliography records for `[R01]` through `[R24]` before BibTeX preparation.

It is a structured bibliography-planning table. It does not generate BibTeX, does not modify the manuscript, and does not make the paper submission-ready.

## Scope

This normalized bibliography covers:

- references `[R01]` through `[R24]`
- the current reference tracker
- citation audit v0.1
- citation style decision
- reference metadata audit v0.1
- metadata gap resolution v0.1

This pass does not generate BibTeX. This pass does not modify manuscript v0.3. The paper remains not submission-ready.

## Normalization Rules

- Preserve stable `[Rxx]` labels.
- Do not invent missing metadata.
- Separate paper/preprint references, official docs, official repositories, and artifact/evaluation guidance.
- Use organization owner for official docs and repositories when an individual author list is not appropriate.
- Mark unresolved fields explicitly.
- Track whether a record is ready for BibTeX.
- Keep venue-specific conversion deferred.
- Keep tracker-only references out of the manuscript References section unless they are cited in manuscript text later.

Metadata gap resolution status:

- [KORA First Paper Metadata Gap Resolution v0.1](kora-first-paper-metadata-gap-resolution-v0-1.md) classifies the remaining high-risk entries before BibTeX preparation.
- [KORA First Paper Docs/Repo Reference Style Resolution v0.1](kora-first-paper-docs-repo-reference-style-resolution-v0-1.md) classifies official docs/repo entries before any docs/repo BibTeX expansion.
- Official docs and repositories remain blocked on docs/repo style and access-date decisions.
- Artifact guidance remains blocked on policy/venue-guidance style decisions.
- Selected paper/preprint entries remain blocked on author-list or venue/status normalization.

## BibTeX Readiness Summary

Ready for preliminary BibTeX after normalized record check:

- `[R01]`, `[R06]`, `[R08]`, `[R11]`, `[R14]`, `[R21]`, `[R24]`

Needs author-list normalization:

- `[R02]`, `[R19]`, `[R20]`, `[R22]`, `[R23]`

Needs venue/status normalization:

- `[R02]`, `[R05]`, `[R12]`, `[R13]`, `[R16]`

Needs docs/repo style decision:

- `[R03]`, `[R04]`, `[R07]`, `[R09]`, `[R15]`

Needs venue/artifact guidance style decision:

- `[R10]`

Defer until target venue chosen:

- `[R17]`, `[R18]`

Not ready for BibTeX:

- Any reference whose author-list handling, venue/status, official-docs access-date treatment, or venue-guidance style remains unresolved.
- No BibTeX is generated in this document.

## Metadata Gap List

Missing or uncertain author/org:

- `[R02]`, `[R19]`, `[R20]`, `[R22]`, `[R23]`: author-list expansion or final `et al.` handling requires review before BibTeX.

Missing or uncertain venue/status:

- `[R02]`, `[R05]`, `[R12]`, `[R13]`, `[R16]`: arXiv or report status needs final venue/status normalization.

Official docs date/access-date treatment:

- `[R03]`, `[R04]`, `[R07]`, `[R09]`, `[R15]`: official docs or repository entries need final organization-owner, entry-type, and access-date formatting.

DOI/URL issues:

- No missing source URL was identified in the tracker for `[R01]` through `[R24]`.
- DOI availability differs by source type. Official docs, repositories, and venue guidance pages use stable source URLs rather than DOI records.

Venue-specific formatting needs:

- `[R10]`, `[R17]`, `[R18]`: artifact policy or venue guidance pages need final venue-style treatment.
- Venue-specific conversion remains deferred for all records until target venue or report format is selected.

## Claim-Safety Note

The normalized bibliography does not change claim support.

- External references remain related-work, methodology, background, reproducibility, artifact-practice, or future-work support only.
- KORA's 80/100 result remains supported by KORA deterministic-heavy benchmark docs and evidence.
- These references do not support production cost reduction proof.
- These references do not support real API-cost reduction proof.
- These references do not support energy reduction evidence.
- These references do not support production benchmark proof.
- These references do not support broad workload superiority.
- Artifact guidance references do not imply formal artifact approval.

## Next Step

Next steps:

1. Resolve remaining source/style decisions for entries still blocked before BibTeX.
2. Prepare preliminary BibTeX only for records with complete verified fields.
3. Keep the paper not submission-ready until BibTeX, bibliography, and final claim audit are stable.

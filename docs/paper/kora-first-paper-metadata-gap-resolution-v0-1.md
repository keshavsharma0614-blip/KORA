# KORA First Paper Metadata Gap Resolution v0.1

## Purpose

This document resolves or classifies high-risk metadata gaps before BibTeX preparation for the KORA first paper.

It is a bibliography-readiness planning document. It does not generate BibTeX, does not modify the manuscript, and does not make the paper submission-ready.

## Scope

This pass covers the high-risk entries identified in [KORA First Paper Reference Metadata Audit v0.1](kora-first-paper-reference-metadata-audit-v0-1.md) and represented in [KORA First Paper Normalized Bibliography v0.1](kora-first-paper-normalized-bibliography-v0-1.md).

Scope includes:

- official docs and repository references requiring organization-owner, access-date, and entry-type handling
- artifact policy and venue guidance pages requiring careful style treatment
- paper, preprint, benchmark, and report references requiring author-list or venue/status normalization
- no BibTeX generation
- no manuscript changes

## Resolution Rules

- Do not invent metadata.
- Do not infer missing authors, venues, years, dates, DOIs, or URLs.
- Official docs and repositories should use the project or organization owner when an individual author list is not appropriate.
- Official docs and repositories may require access-date fields in the final bibliography or BibTeX style.
- Artifact guidance pages should be treated as policy or venue guidance pages, not as formal artifact approval.
- Paper and preprint entries require author-list and venue/status normalization before BibTeX fields are generated.
- Unresolved fields remain explicitly marked until a later source-check or venue-style pass resolves them.
- Stable `[Rxx]` labels remain unchanged.

## Docs/Repo Style Resolution

[KORA First Paper Docs/Repo Reference Style Resolution v0.1](kora-first-paper-docs-repo-reference-style-resolution-v0-1.md) classifies `[R03]`, `[R04]`, `[R07]`, `[R09]`, and `[R15]`.

Status:

- `[R03]`, `[R04]`, and `[R07]` are ready for docs-style BibTeX later after final docs entry type and access-date field style are chosen.
- `[R09]` is ready for repository-style BibTeX later after final repository entry type and access-date field style are chosen.
- `[R15]` remains blocked until the final split-or-keep decision is made for the combined docs/repo reference.
- No BibTeX is generated for these records in this pass.

## Artifact Guidance Style Resolution

[KORA First Paper Artifact Guidance Reference Style Resolution v0.1](kora-first-paper-artifact-guidance-reference-style-resolution-v0-1.md) classifies `[R10]`, `[R17]`, and `[R18]`.

Status:

- `[R10]` is ready for artifact-guidance BibTeX later after final policy-page entry type and access-date field style are chosen.
- `[R17]` and `[R18]` remain deferred until target venue selection confirms whether USENIX/NSDI-style or MLSys-style guidance belongs in the final bibliography.
- No BibTeX is generated for these records in this pass.

## Updated BibTeX Readiness

Ready for preliminary BibTeX after normalized record check:

- `[R01]`, `[R06]`, `[R08]`, `[R11]`, `[R14]`, `[R21]`, `[R24]`

Needs author-list normalization:

- `[R02]`, `[R19]`, `[R20]`, `[R22]`, `[R23]`

Needs venue/status normalization:

- `[R02]`, `[R05]`, `[R12]`, `[R13]`, `[R16]`

Needs docs/repo style decision:

- `[R03]`, `[R04]`, `[R07]`, `[R09]`, `[R15]`

Needs artifact guidance access-date/style decision:

- `[R10]`

Defer until target venue chosen:

- `[R17]`, `[R18]`

## Entries Still Blocked Before BibTeX

The following entries should not receive BibTeX yet:

- `[R02]`: author-list handling and venue/status normalization remain unresolved.
- `[R03]`, `[R04]`, `[R07]`, `[R09]`, `[R15]`: docs/repo entry style and access-date formatting remain unresolved.
- `[R05]`, `[R12]`, `[R13]`, `[R16]`: venue/status normalization remains unresolved.
- `[R10]`: policy/guidance entry style and access-date field style remain unresolved.
- `[R17]`, `[R18]`: target-venue decision and venue-guidance entry style remain unresolved.
- `[R19]`, `[R20]`, `[R22]`, `[R23]`: author-list handling remains unresolved.

## Claim-Safety Note

Metadata gap resolution does not change claim support.

- External references remain related-work, methodology, background, reproducibility, artifact-practice, or future-work support only.
- KORA's 80/100 result remains supported by KORA deterministic-heavy benchmark docs and evidence.
- These references do not support production cost reduction proof.
- These references do not support real API-cost reduction proof.
- These references do not support energy reduction evidence.
- These references do not support production benchmark proof.
- These references do not support broad workload superiority.
- Bibliography metadata does not imply formal artifact approval.

## Next Step

Next steps:

1. Update normalized bibliography records after any remaining source checks or style decisions.
2. Prepare preliminary BibTeX only for records whose fields are complete and verified.
3. Keep the paper not submission-ready until BibTeX, bibliography, and final claim audit are stable.

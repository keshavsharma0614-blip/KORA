# KORA Studio v0 (Mac Demo Scaffold)

KORA Studio v0 is a minimal local AI Task Execution Router / Execution Viewer demo for macOS development.
It includes a small FastAPI backend and a single-screen React UI.

The demo should be read as a local workflow-routing scaffold, not an LM Studio replacement or a generic local chatbot. LM Studio helps users run local models. KORA Studio routes local AI workflows by making the model one execution path, not the default path.

## What This Demo Shows

- A simple execution-viewer style metro map with stage replay animation
- Real-time station replay via Server-Sent Events (SSE) from `/api/sse_run`
- Stage-level metric badges (status/time and adapter token usage) overlaid on each station during replay
- Skip routing visualization (Decision -> Output bypass) when deterministic-first logic skips LLM execution
- Direct vs KORA comparison view using recent run history (cost/tokens/latency deltas for same prompt)
- A metrics panel fed by backend demo telemetry (`LLM calls`, `tokens`, `estimated cost`, `stage counts`)
- A local-only scaffold to iterate before wiring real runtime streaming

## Capability Boundary

- Your machine may be comfortable with a specific local model tier.
- KORA does not make large models smaller.
- KORA does not remove RAM, VRAM, unified-memory, or model-loading requirements.
- KORA makes larger-model workflows lighter by sending less work to the model.
- KORA routes deterministic and structured work to CPU/local fast paths first.
- The model becomes one execution path, not the default path.
- Provider, cloud, and distributed routes are not enabled by default in this demo.

## Current API Wiring

- `POST /api/run`
  - body: `{"prompt": "...", "mode": "kora|direct", "adapter": "openai|mock"}`
  - currently frontend uses `mode="kora"` and `adapter="mock"` by default
  - executes a minimal TaskGraph via `run_graph()` and stores events in memory
- `GET /api/sse_run?run_id=<id>`
  - streams run events in sequence for metro-map animation

## Run Backend

The repository-level local preview skeleton launches with:

```bash
python3 -m kora studio
```

It starts the localhost-only server on `127.0.0.1:8765`, opens the default browser unless `--no-browser` is set, keeps provider calls and cloud sync disabled by default, and requires no API key for default local mode. If browser launch fails, it prints the manual local URL and keeps serving locally.

The preview `/status` response includes a local system profile scaffold and model capability estimate. The estimate is heuristic and local-only; recommendations are estimates until validated on the machine and do not claim unsupported larger-model execution.

The preview also includes a static local model catalog scaffold. Catalog recommendations are curated examples, do not fetch remote registries, do not download or execute models, and do not imply all open-source LLMs are supported.

Runtime status is also exposed as a local scaffold. Executable detection is local-only, catalog examples are not installed models, service reachability and installed-model detection may remain unknown, and download/execution actions are not connected.

Catalog action labels are disabled planning scaffolds only. The preview may show "Download not connected yet" and "Run not connected yet"; these labels do not download, execute, call a registry, or call a provider.

The separate FastAPI/React demo scaffold can still be run manually:

From repo root:

```bash
cd studio/backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -e .
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

If importing `kora` fails, run from repo root context or set:
`PYTHONPATH=../..`

## Run Frontend

From repo root:

```bash
cd studio/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
Backend: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Next Milestones

- Replace in-memory demo SSE with true live event streaming directly from active `run_graph()` execution
- Live runtime trigger from UI input
- Multi-run timeline and report comparison views

# KORA Studio v0 (Mac Demo Scaffold)

KORA Studio v0 is a minimal local AI Task Execution Router / Execution Viewer demo for macOS development.
It includes a small FastAPI backend and a single-screen React UI.

The demo should be read as a local workflow-routing scaffold, not an LM Studio replacement or a generic local chatbot. LM Studio helps users run local models. KORA Studio routes local AI workflows by making the model one execution path, not the default path.

## What This Demo Shows

- A simple execution-viewer style metro map with stage replay animation
- Real-time station replay via Server-Sent Events (SSE) from `/api/sse_run`
- Stage-level metric badges (status/time and adapter token usage) overlaid on each station during replay
- Skip routing visualization (Decision -> Output bypass) when deterministic-first logic skips LLM execution
- Direct vs KORA comparison view using recent run history (cost/tokens/latency deltas for same prompt)
- A metrics panel fed by backend demo telemetry (`LLM calls`, `tokens`, `estimated cost`, `stage counts`)
- A local-only scaffold to iterate before wiring real runtime streaming

## Capability Boundary

- Your machine may be comfortable with a specific local model tier.
- KORA does not make large models smaller.
- KORA does not remove RAM, VRAM, unified-memory, or model-loading requirements.
- KORA makes larger-model workflows lighter by sending less work to the model.
- KORA routes deterministic and structured work to CPU/local fast paths first.
- The model becomes one execution path, not the default path.
- Provider, cloud, and distributed routes are not enabled by default in this demo.

## Current API Wiring

- `POST /api/run`
  - body: `{"prompt": "...", "mode": "kora|direct", "adapter": "openai|mock"}`
  - currently frontend uses `mode="kora"` and `adapter="mock"` by default
  - executes a minimal TaskGraph via `run_graph()` and stores events in memory
- `GET /api/sse_run?run_id=<id>`
  - streams run events in sequence for metro-map animation

## Run Backend

From repo root:

```bash
cd studio/backend
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -e .
uvicorn app.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

If importing `kora` fails, run from repo root context or set:
`PYTHONPATH=../..`

## Run Frontend

From repo root:

```bash
cd studio/frontend
npm install
npm run dev
```

Frontend: [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)
Backend: [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000)

## Next Milestones

- Replace in-memory demo SSE with true live event streaming directly from active `run_graph()` execution
- Live runtime trigger from UI input
- Multi-run timeline and report comparison views

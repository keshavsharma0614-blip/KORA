# KORA

Open-source execution control for AI workloads.

Most AI apps call the model too soon.

Every request becomes a prompt.
Every prompt becomes tokens.
Every token becomes latency, cost, and infrastructure pressure.

KORA turns AI requests into structured execution paths before inference: task graphs, deterministic-first execution, validation, telemetry, and model escalation only when needed.

Before:

```text
request -> prompt -> model -> output
```

After:

```text
request -> task graph -> deterministic path -> validation -> model escalation -> telemetry
```

Structure first. Inference second.

## Prerequisites

KORA uses `pyproject.toml`-based Python packaging.

- Packaged support: Python 3.11 or newer, as declared in `pyproject.toml`.
- Observed local result: Python 3.9.6 has been confirmed to run the offline `direct_vs_kora` example in one user environment.
- Treat Python 3.9.6 as an observed troubleshooting datapoint, not as the advertised package support floor until clean Python 3.9 compatibility testing is completed.
- Before making Python-version compatibility assumptions, check the active interpreter with `python3 --version`.
- VS Code's selected interpreter may differ from terminal `python3`; make sure both point to the intended environment when debugging setup issues.
- Upgrade `pip`, `setuptools`, and `wheel` before editable install so local tooling understands modern `pyproject.toml` builds.

Check your local tools first:

```bash
python3 --version
python3 -m pip --version
which python3
```

## 3-Minute Local Run

For local development in this repository:

```bash
python3 --version

rm -rf .venv
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
python3 -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

If editable install reports that `setup.py`, `setup.cfg`, or install metadata is missing, first verify that your checkout is current:

```bash
git remote -v
git fetch origin
git checkout main
git pull origin main
ls pyproject.toml
```

If `pyproject.toml` is still missing after pulling, re-clone from `https://github.com/Krako-Labs/KORA.git`.

Run the CLI and first offline demo:

```bash
python3 -m kora --help
python3 -m kora examples list
python3 -m kora run hello_kora -- --offline
python3 -m kora run direct_vs_kora -- --offline
```

Inspect the output to see how KORA changes a direct model-first path into a controlled execution path.

## Local Setup Troubleshooting

If first-run setup fails after a system restart, Python upgrade, VS Code interpreter change, or virtual environment change, start by collecting the active environment:

```bash
python3 --version
python3 -m pip --version
python3 -m pip show pydantic
which python3
```

### `TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for |: 'ModelMetaclass' and 'ModelMetaclass'`

This usually indicates a local Python, virtual environment, `pip`, `setuptools`, or dependency compatibility problem. Python 3.9.6 has been observed to run the offline `direct_vs_kora` example in one user environment, but packaged support is currently Python 3.11 or newer. First rebuild the local environment with current build tooling:

```bash
rm -rf .venv
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate

python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
python3 -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
python3 -m kora run hello_kora -- --offline
python3 -m kora run direct_vs_kora -- --offline
```

Do not assume this error means a newer Python version is unsupported. Test Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, or 3.12 in clean environments before changing the package support floor.

### Editable install says `setup.py` or `setup.cfg` is missing

KORA uses `pyproject.toml`-based packaging, so a missing `setup.py` or `setup.cfg` message usually means the local `pip`/build tooling is too old or the virtual environment is stale. Confirm `pyproject.toml` exists, upgrade build tooling, then reinstall:

```bash
ls pyproject.toml
python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel
python3 -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

### VS Code interpreter differs from terminal `python3`

If KORA works in Terminal but fails in VS Code, compare the selected VS Code interpreter against terminal `python3`:

```bash
which python3
python3 --version
python3 -m pip --version
```

Select the repository `.venv` interpreter in VS Code, then reopen the terminal or restart the Python language server before rerunning the examples.

## What KORA Does

KORA sits between an AI request and a model call.

It helps developers:

- turn requests into explicit task graphs
- run deterministic work before inference
- validate outputs before escalation
- make model calls conditional instead of default
- record telemetry around each execution path
- compare direct model-first execution against controlled execution

KORA does not try to make models smarter. It controls when, why, and how they are used.

## Current Alpha Evidence

KORA reduced model invocations by 80% in a reproducible deterministic-heavy benchmark workload.

![KORA benchmark evidence card](docs/assets/kora-benchmark-evidence-card.png)

This result is based on the current deterministic-heavy alpha benchmark and should not be interpreted as a universal production cost-reduction claim.

## What We Are Testing Next

1. Runtime-integrated benchmark paths with real model calls
2. [Customer-support triage workloads](docs/workloads/customer-support-triage.md)
3. RAG answer-routing workloads
4. Agent budget-guard workloads

We are looking for early developers and AI app teams who want to test KORA against real workloads.

KORA validation roadmap.

See the [KORA validation roadmap](docs/benchmarks/validation-roadmap.md) for the measurement plan.

See the [real model-call validation design](docs/benchmarks/real-model-call-validation-design.md) for the next measurement path.

KORA includes a local no-network validation path that measures model-call routing without requiring API keys or external providers.

Customer-support triage local validation is available as a no-network example.

Local no-network validation examples can generate Markdown reports with `--report-md`.

Local no-network validation examples support `--adapter local_validation` by default and explicit `--adapter local_runtime` for the deterministic in-process local runtime stub.

Reviewer packet: [local no-network validation](docs/benchmarks/local-validation-reviewer-packet.md).

The reviewer packet includes the no-network baseline checklist, adapter-selection commands, fail-closed safety checks, and local Markdown report generation examples.

Local model adapter design: [provider-neutral local runtime path](docs/benchmarks/local-model-adapter-design.md).

Real provider adapter design-only packet: [future provider boundary](docs/benchmarks/real-provider-adapter-design.md).

Real provider test harness design-only packet: [dry-run provider validation contract](docs/benchmarks/real-provider-test-harness-design.md).

KORA is a standalone open-source execution control layer for AI systems. It structures requests into task graphs, runs deterministic work first, and escalates to model inference only when needed.

KORA v0.1 is terminal-first and developer-oriented.

## What KORA Is

KORA sits between a request and a model call.

Instead of treating every request as an immediate prompt-to-model operation, KORA turns execution into a structured path:

- decompose work into task graphs
- run deterministic tasks first
- enforce budgets and stage boundaries
- validate outputs against explicit structure
- escalate to model inference only when deterministic execution is insufficient
- record telemetry for inspection and replay

KORA provides execution control before model invocation.

## Install

Target install path for v0.1:

```bash
pip install kora
```

Homebrew install path for v0.1:

```bash
brew install kora
```

For local development in this repository:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quickstart

Terminal-first v0.1 CLI flow:

```bash
kora examples list
kora run hello_kora
kora run direct_vs_kora
kora telemetry --input artifacts/run.json
```

Current examples available in this repository:

- examples/hello_kora
- examples/direct_vs_kora
- examples/retry_demo
- examples/real_workload_harness
- examples/stress_test

Example local runs:

```bash
python3 -m kora run hello_kora
python3 -m kora run direct_vs_kora
python3 -m kora telemetry --input artifacts/run.json
```

## What KORA Does

KORA structures requests before inference.

In practice, that means:

- separating deterministic work from inference work
- making model invocation conditional instead of default
- enforcing validation and retry boundaries around uncertain steps
- exposing telemetry so execution can be measured, compared, and debugged

KORA does not try to make models smarter. It controls when, why, and how they are used.

## Why KORA Exists

Many AI applications still default to a simple pattern:

`request -> prompt -> model -> output`

That pattern is easy to start with, but it makes several problems harder to control:

- unnecessary model calls
- unstable latency envelopes
- weak execution visibility
- fragile output handling
- limited separation between deterministic logic and probabilistic logic

KORA exists to make execution structure explicit. If part of a request can be handled deterministically, it should be handled deterministically first. Inference should be an escalation path, not the baseline.

## Included in v0.1

- execution-layer primitives for structured AI workloads
- task graph and scheduler foundations
- deterministic-first execution and verification components
- telemetry summarization and reporting
- repository examples covering direct-vs-structured execution, retries, and stress behavior
- terminal-first developer workflow

## Not Included in v0.1

- GUI-first product
- KORA Studio in the main release
- chatbot interface
- desktop AI app
- model hosting or model serving engine

## Who KORA Is For

KORA is for developers and researchers building AI systems that need stronger execution control.

Typical users include:

- engineers who want deterministic preprocessing and validation before model calls
- teams comparing direct inference against structured execution
- developers who need telemetry and bounded execution semantics
- researchers exploring decomposition, verification, and escalation strategies

## What KORA Is Not

KORA is not:

- a chatbot
- a desktop AI app
- a ChatGPT alternative
- a model serving engine
- another agent wrapper that only forwards prompts to providers
- a dependent layer inside another platform

KORA is a standalone open-source execution control layer.

## Roadmap

Near-term work after v0.1:

- stabilize the terminal CLI around init, run, examples, and trace flows
- expand example coverage around structured execution patterns
- improve packaging and distribution for standard developer install paths
- deepen documentation for task graphs, execution semantics, and telemetry inspection
- continue benchmark and validation work for deterministic-first execution

Future work may include KORA Studio, but it is outside the main v0.1 release scope.

# KORA

Open-source execution control for AI workloads.

Most AI apps call the model too soon.

Every request becomes a prompt.
Every prompt becomes tokens.
Every token becomes latency, cost, and infrastructure pressure.

KORA turns AI requests into structured execution paths before inference: task graphs, deterministic-first execution, validation, telemetry, and model escalation only when needed.

![KORA execution control overview](docs/assets/kora-execution-control-overview.png)

Before:

```text
request -> prompt -> model -> output
```

After:

```text
request -> task graph -> deterministic path -> validation -> model escalation -> telemetry
```

Structure first. Inference second.

## 3-Minute Local Run

For local development in this repository:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

Run the CLI and first offline demo:

```bash
python3 -m kora --help
python3 -m kora examples list
python3 -m kora run direct_vs_kora -- --offline
```

Inspect the output to see how KORA changes a direct model-first path into a controlled execution path.

## What KORA Does

KORA sits between an AI request and a model call.

It helps developers:

- turn requests into explicit task graphs
- run deterministic work before inference
- validate outputs before escalation
- make model calls conditional instead of default
- record telemetry around each execution path
- compare direct model-first execution against controlled execution

KORA does not try to make models smarter. It controls when, why, and how they are used.

## Current Alpha Evidence

KORA reduced model invocations by 80% in a reproducible deterministic-heavy benchmark workload.

![KORA benchmark evidence card](docs/assets/kora-benchmark-evidence-card.png)

This result is based on the current deterministic-heavy alpha benchmark and should not be interpreted as a universal production cost-reduction claim.

## What We Are Testing Next

1. Runtime-integrated benchmark paths with real model calls
2. [Customer-support triage workloads](docs/workloads/customer-support-triage.md)
3. RAG answer-routing workloads
4. Agent budget-guard workloads

We are looking for early developers and AI app teams who want to test KORA against real workloads.

KORA validation roadmap.

See the [KORA validation roadmap](docs/benchmarks/validation-roadmap.md) for the measurement plan.

See the [real model-call validation design](docs/benchmarks/real-model-call-validation-design.md) for the next measurement path.

KORA includes a local no-network validation path that measures model-call routing without requiring API keys or external providers.

Customer-support triage local validation is available as a no-network example.

Local no-network validation examples can generate Markdown reports with `--report-md`.

Local no-network validation examples support `--adapter local_validation` by default and explicit `--adapter local_runtime` for the deterministic in-process local runtime stub.

Reviewer packet: [local no-network validation](docs/benchmarks/local-validation-reviewer-packet.md).

The reviewer packet includes the no-network baseline checklist, adapter-selection commands, fail-closed safety checks, and local Markdown report generation examples.

Local model adapter design: [provider-neutral local runtime path](docs/benchmarks/local-model-adapter-design.md).

Real provider adapter design-only packet: [future provider boundary](docs/benchmarks/real-provider-adapter-design.md).

Real provider test harness design-only packet: [dry-run provider validation contract](docs/benchmarks/real-provider-test-harness-design.md).

## Help Test KORA

Good candidate workloads:

- customer-support triage
- repetitive RAG workflows
- agent workflows with budget or escalation rules
- deterministic-heavy backend workflows
- LLM apps with high repeated request patterns

## Install

Target package install path:

```bash
pip install kora
```

Homebrew install path:

```bash
brew install kora
```

For the current repository alpha, use the editable local install in the [3-Minute Local Run](#3-minute-local-run).

## Current Examples

Current examples available in this repository:

- `examples/hello_kora`
- `examples/direct_vs_kora`
- `examples/retry_demo`
- `examples/real_workload_harness`
- `examples/stress_test`
- `examples/runtime_integrated_benchmark`

Use `--offline` for reproducible first-run paths without OpenAI credentials.

## Alpha Scope

Included in the alpha surface:

- execution-layer primitives for structured AI workloads
- task graph and scheduler foundations
- deterministic-first execution and verification components
- telemetry summarization and reporting
- repository examples covering direct-vs-structured execution, retries, stress behavior, and runtime evidence flow
- terminal-first developer workflow

Not included in the alpha surface:

- GUI-first product
- chatbot interface
- desktop AI app
- model hosting or model serving engine
- production cost-reduction proof
- real API-cost reduction proof
- energy reduction evidence

## What KORA Is Not

KORA is not:

- a chatbot
- a desktop AI app (not yet)
- a hosted chat-product alternative
- a model serving engine
- another agent wrapper that only forwards prompts to providers

KORA is a standalone open-source execution-control layer for AI workloads.

KORA is a standalone open-source execution control layer for AI systems. It structures requests into task graphs, runs deterministic work first, and escalates to model inference only when needed.

> Repository note: KORA has moved into its official Krako Labs home at https://github.com/Krako-Labs/KORA. Same code, same history, bigger mission.

## Current Release

Current published release: [`v0.2.0-alpha`](https://github.com/Krako-Labs/KORA/releases/tag/v0.2.0-alpha).

KORA is still alpha / prerelease software. The `v0.2.0-alpha` release focuses on bounded deterministic-heavy benchmark evidence for the terminal-first developer surface. No release assets were uploaded, and no raw benchmark JSON artifacts were uploaded.

Want to contribute? Start with [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md), browse [good first issue candidates](docs/good_first_issues.md), and review [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md), [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md), and [CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). Community moderators can use the [KORA community manager guide](docs/community/KORA_COMMUNITY_MANAGER_GUIDE.md).

## Documentation

Start with the [KORA Documentation Index](docs/README.md) to find technical docs, benchmark evidence, claim guidance, community workflows, and operating docs.

For current benchmark evidence and claim boundaries, see the [changelog](CHANGELOG.md), [experiments regeneration guide](experiments/README.md), [benchmark artifact policy](docs/reports/benchmark_artifact_policy.md), [raw artifact freeze decision](docs/reports/v0.2.0-alpha-raw-artifact-freeze-decision.md), [100-task benchmark summary](docs/benchmarks/kora_benchmark_result_v1_100.md), and [claim registry](docs/claims/kora-claim-registry.md).

## What KORA Is

KORA sits between a request and a model call.

Instead of treating every request as an immediate prompt-to-model operation, KORA turns execution into a structured path:

- decompose work into task graphs
- run deterministic tasks first
- enforce budgets and stage boundaries
- validate outputs against explicit structure
- escalate to model inference only when deterministic execution is insufficient
- record telemetry for inspection and replay

KORA provides execution control before model invocation.

## Install

Target package install path:

```bash
pip install kora
```

Homebrew install path:

```bash
brew install kora
```

For local development in this repository:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
python3 -m pip install -e ".[dev]"
```

## Quickstart

For local development in this repository, after installing with `python3 -m pip install -e ".[dev]"`, use:

```bash
python3 -m kora --help
python3 -m kora examples list
python3 -m kora run hello_kora
python3 -m kora run retry_demo
python3 -m kora run direct_vs_kora -- --offline
```

Use `--offline` for the reproducible first-run demo path without OpenAI credentials.

Expected first-run shape:

- `hello_kora` completes with JSON containing `status: "ok"` and `message: "hello from kora"`. It shows the basic deterministic graph path.
- `retry_demo` completes with `final_output.status: "ok"`, `message: "recovered"`, and an `event_count` greater than one. It shows retry/recovery behavior without changing the public CLI.
- `direct_vs_kora -- --offline` prints `Running direct_vs_kora in offline mock mode`, then a local direct-vs-KORA comparison with simulated call counters such as `llm_calls_direct_total`, `llm_calls_kora_total`, and `llm_calls_reduced_total`.

The offline comparison uses mock local behavior and does not call external APIs. Treat it as a first-run demonstration, not production benchmark evidence. For benchmark evidence and regeneration policy, see [experiments/README.md](experiments/README.md) and [benchmark_artifact_policy.md](docs/reports/benchmark_artifact_policy.md).

If KORA is installed as a command-line package, the equivalent commands are:

```bash
kora --help
kora examples list
kora run hello_kora
kora run retry_demo
kora run direct_vs_kora -- --offline
```

Online variant:

```bash
kora run direct_vs_kora
```

Current examples available in this repository:

- examples/hello_kora
- examples/direct_vs_kora
- examples/retry_demo
- examples/real_workload_harness
- examples/stress_test

`telemetry` can be run immediately with the committed sample input at `docs/reports/sample_telemetry_input.json`, or with a JSON artifact generated by a prior run or report flow. Counter definitions are in [telemetry-and-observability.md](docs/telemetry-and-observability.md#current-public-counters).
After the first-run flow and telemetry summary, see `docs/benchmark-real-app.md` for the next-step benchmark/report path via `real_workload_harness`.

## Benchmark Evidence

Safe claim:

> In a reproducible 100-task deterministic-heavy benchmark workload, KORA-controlled execution avoided 80 of 100 simulated model invocations versus a naive direct baseline.

Current `v0.2.0-alpha` counters:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Total tasks | `100` |
| Direct-baseline simulated model invocations | `100` |
| KORA-controlled simulated model invocations | `20` |
| Avoided simulated model invocations | `80` |
| Avoided invocation rate | `80%` |
| Deterministic outputs checked | `80` |
| Mismatches | `0` |
| Fallback/model-candidate skipped | `20` |

The tracked workload is `experiments/workloads/deterministic_heavy_v1_100.json`. Regeneration uses `experiments/generate_workload.py`, `experiments/run_benchmark.py`, and `experiments/summarize_benchmark_results.py`; commands are documented in [benchmark_artifact_policy.md](docs/reports/benchmark_artifact_policy.md).

Raw benchmark JSON artifacts are reproducible outputs and are not frozen or committed for this alpha release. See the [raw artifact freeze decision](docs/reports/v0.2.0-alpha-raw-artifact-freeze-decision.md).

This evidence does not claim production cost reduction proof, real API-cost reduction proof, production benchmark proof, full runtime-integrated benchmark evidence, broad workload superiority proof, or energy reduction evidence.

## What KORA Does

KORA structures requests before inference.

In practice, that means:

- separating deterministic work from inference work
- making model invocation conditional instead of default
- enforcing validation and retry boundaries around uncertain steps
- exposing telemetry so execution can be measured, compared, and debugged

KORA does not try to make models smarter. It controls when, why, and how they are used.

## Why KORA Exists

Many AI applications still default to a simple pattern:

`request -> prompt -> model -> output`

That pattern is easy to start with, but it makes several problems harder to control:

- unnecessary model calls
- unstable latency envelopes
- weak execution visibility
- fragile output handling
- limited separation between deterministic logic and probabilistic logic

KORA exists to make execution structure explicit. If part of a request can be handled deterministically, it should be handled deterministically first. Inference should be an escalation path, not the baseline.

## Included in the Alpha Surface

- execution-layer primitives for structured AI workloads
- task graph and scheduler foundations
- deterministic-first execution and verification components
- telemetry summarization and reporting
- repository examples covering direct-vs-structured execution, retries, and stress behavior
- terminal-first developer workflow

## Not Included in the Alpha Surface

- GUI-first product
- KORA Studio in the main release
- chatbot interface
- desktop AI app
- model hosting or model serving engine

## Who KORA Is For

KORA is for developers and researchers building AI systems that need stronger execution control.

Typical users include:

- engineers who want deterministic preprocessing and validation before model calls
- teams comparing direct inference against structured execution
- developers who need telemetry and bounded execution semantics
- researchers exploring decomposition, verification, and escalation strategies

## What KORA Is Not

KORA is not:

- a chatbot
- a desktop AI app
- a ChatGPT alternative
- a model serving engine
- another agent wrapper that only forwards prompts to providers
- a dependent layer inside another platform

KORA is a standalone open-source execution control layer.

## Roadmap

Near-term alpha work:

- stabilize the terminal CLI around init, run, examples, and trace flows
- expand example coverage around structured execution patterns
- improve packaging and distribution for standard developer install paths
- deepen documentation for task graphs, execution semantics, and telemetry inspection
- continue benchmark and validation work for deterministic-first execution

Future work may include KORA Studio, but it is outside the main alpha CLI release surface.
